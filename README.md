# JSON in Unity
Code source files for the [Reading and Writing JSON in Unity](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLivfKP2ufIK4YTqDr4eBcwvRR8pLBc1sh) tuturial series.

Instead of having two separate repos for such a small bit of code, I've combined the Read and the Write episodes into a single asset.

Note: This is just the ReadJson.cs, WriteJson.cs, and the [https://lbv.github.io/litjson/](LitJson.dll).
